# Binary-Tools
Welcome to Binary-Tools, a collection of two Python-based command-line applications designed for binary arithmetic and number base conversions. This repository includes:
1. **Binary Calculator**: Performs operations on binary numbers including one's complement, two's complement, addition and subtraction.
2. **Number Base Converter**: Converts numbers between decimal, binary, octal and hexadecimal bases.
This project was developed as a collaborative team effort, with each member contributing specific functionalities to create robust and user-friendly tools for number system computations.

## Features
### Binary Calculator
- Compute the one's complement of a binary number.
- Compute the two's complement of a binary number.
- Perform addition and subtraction of two binary numbers.
- Input validation to ensure only valid binary numbers (0, 1 or -) are processed.
### Number Base Converter
- Convert numbers between decimal, binary, octal and hexadecimal bases.
- Supports conversions such as binary to octal, hexadecimal to decimal, and more.
- Intuitive menu system for selecting input and output bases.
- Input validation for accurate conversions.

## Usage
### Binary Calculator
1. Run BinaryCalculator.py.
2. Choose option A to input a binary number or B to exit.
3. Enter a valid binary number (e.g., 1010 or -1101).
4. Select an operation:
    a: Compute one's complement.
    b: Compute two's complement.
    c: Add a second binary number.
    d: Subtract a second binary number.
5. View the result and return to the main menu.
### Number Base Converter
1. Run NumberConversion.py.
2. Choose option A to input a number or B to exit.
3. Enter a number in the chosen base.
4. Select the base to convert from (Decimal, Binary, Octal or Hexadecimal).
5. Select the base to convert to.
6. View the converted result and return to the main menu.

## My Contributions
As a key contributor to this project, I was responsible for:
### Number Base Converter:
Developed the binary to octal and octal to binary conversion functionalities, ensuring accurate and efficient conversions through intermediate decimal processing.
### Binary Calculator:
Implemented the one's complement and two's complement functions, enabling reliable binary number manipulations.
### Both Apps:
Enhanced the menu systems by improving user input validation and error handling, resulting in a smoother and more intuitive user experience.

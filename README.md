# Binary-Tools
**Binary Tools** a collection of two Python-based command-line applications designed for binary arithmetic and number base conversions. This repository includes:
1. **Binary Calculator**
2. **Number Base Converter**

## Features
### Binary Calculator
- Compute the one's complement of a binary number.
- Compute the two's complement of a binary number.
- Perform addition and subtraction of two binary numbers.
- Input validation to ensure only valid binary numbers (0, 1 or -) are processed.
### Number Base Converter
- Convert numbers between decimal, binary, octal and hexadecimal bases.
- Supports complex conversions such as binary to octal, Octal to hexadecimal and more.
- Input validation for accurate conversions.

## My Contributions
As a key contributor to this project, I was responsible for:
### Number Base Converter:
Developed the binary to octal and octal to binary conversion functionalities, ensuring accurate and efficient conversions through intermediate decimal processing.
### Binary Calculator:
Implemented the one's complement and two's complement functions, enabling reliable binary number manipulations.
### Both Apps:
Enhanced the menu systems by improving user input validation and error handling, resulting in a smoother and more intuitive user experience.
